        In this presentation we will explore the causes, effect, and solution to air pollution. The air we breath is essential for human life, 
     but it's being compromised by the increasing levels of air pollution.One of the primary sources of air pollution is vehicle emission, 
    through the exhaust pipes of cars,trucks, buses, and other vehicles.</b>

    <p  class="ai"><b>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutant
         in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living being,or causes damage
          to the climate or to materials. Is also the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment either
           by chemical, physical, or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. And also is the presence of harmful substances 
           in the air we breathe including particulate matter and gases.

        produced by gasoline and diesel vehicles, including road dust. Vehicles, including cars, trucks, and airplanes emmit oxides, pollutant like carbon

       Agriculture is often associated with fresh air,green pastures, and a tranquil environment. However, Agriculture activities can 
       also be a significant sources of air pollution, contributing to poor air quality and negatively impacting human health and the environment.
       Agricultural activities(Bush burning) refers to the intentional or 
       accidental burning of vegetation in rural naturals areas also known as wildland fires or forest fires.Farming practices, such as plowing and 
       fertilizers, can release particulate matter, ammonia, and other pollutant into the air.

            Air pollution is a silent assassin, lurking in every conor of our life, threatening our hralth and well-being. It's a ticking 
        time bomb, waiting to unleash it's deadly effect on our bodies. The air we breath,once through to the clean and pure, is now filled with toxic
         pollutant that can cause a range of health problem.Air pollution's most obvious victim is our respiratory system. The lungs, designed to 
        take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, are now forced to contend with a cocktail of pollutants. Particulate matter,
         nitrogen dioxide, and ozone can cause:
